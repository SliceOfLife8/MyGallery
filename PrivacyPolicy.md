# PicsWall Privacy Policy

Welcome to the PicsWall app for iOS!

This is an open source iOS app developed by **Christos Petimezas**. The source code is available on GitHub & the app is also available on App Store.

As an iOS user, I take privacy very seriously as I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not developed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data are stored through CoreData & UserDefaults, so everything is been erased when you uninstall the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,<br>
Christos Petimezas<br>
